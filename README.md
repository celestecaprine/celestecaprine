# Hello, world! ![Shebang](shebang.gif)

I'm Shebang, a *nix specialist that loves tinkering and maintaining systems.

Here you'll find a lot of the stuff I'm working on at the moment. 
Though, as I'm not a huge programmer, they'll tend to be moreso revolving around things
I use to manage my systems, with a few code projects sprinkled in
between.

At the moment, I've been putting efforts towards working on solutions for my
community [Coney Poney](https://github.com/coney-poney).

I am fairly proficient with:

- CI/CD workflows
- Containerization (Podman, Docker, K8s)
- Python
- Shell script

If you need to get in touch, these will probably get you the quickest responses:
